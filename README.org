(WIP)

* Software Goals
** Merge Separate Scans

** Automated


* Baked in assumptions

- Optical scan is longer than the XRF scan
- You can't fuse areas that haven't been scanned with XRF
- You can have one optical scan per XRF scan
- Elements/columns are consistent bettwen different scans in one "group"
- Always fuse on the "right" side
- One pixel = 0.5mm
- the equivalent of 0mm on the XRF Scan will match the left side of the first pixel on the optical scan
- mm/pix is constant between scans
- scan width is 5mm and constant between scans


* Outstanding issue

- Saving to CSV cuts off the data
- Save the state on a separate thread so the app doesn't lock up saving things to file
- Get a scanning area pixel intensity average
- Find a way to display this pixel average under the plot
